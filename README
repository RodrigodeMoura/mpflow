mpflow is a front-end to mpd (Music Player Daemon) that has an interface
that was greatly inspired by CoverFlow(tm).

It displays the album art that you have in your music directories.
mpflow looks for these files in each directory:
  - cover.jpg
  - Folder.jpg
  - AlbumArtSmall.jpg

mpflow expects your music directory to be arranged in one directory
per album, with a cover.jpg in it.

mpflow is a simple player that has a basic set of features:
- browse         (cursor keys  or click on the sides)
- play directory (double-click or press Enter)
- pause playback (single click or press Space)
- shuffle        (shake window or press Tab)
- skip song      (right click  or press backspace)


At this point, mpflow is primarily intended as a cover browser rather
than a full-fledged mp3 player. For things like changing the volume,
use gnome-volume-control or whatever. If you want playlists, use a
different front-end. I use Sonata.


For optimal joy, cover.jpg files should be 256x256 or 512x512 in size.
A resolution like 300x300 works well too, as long as it's square.
Smaller sizes like 128x128 do work, but get blurry.
